# Goodwill Website Redesign
As the marketing intern at Goodwill one of my primary responsibilities was creating and updating content for the website. My first big goal when I arrived was to redesign the top-level webpages, especially the homepage, to match modern best practices. Below are screenshots of the website's homepage before and after the redesign.

**Technology Used**: Wordpress, Divi, HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Detailed Explanation of Changes Below Images

## Specific Changes
**Problem**: Masthead, and other full-width modules, were being cropped on screens wider than 1440px. Modern devices and monitors are often 1920px or wider.
**Solution**: Site-wide max-width of 1600px. I replaced any images that were still poorly cropped at 1600px with appropriately sized images.
 
**Problem**: Lack of visual hierarchy and important content above the fold.
**Solution**: I made the mission statement larger at the top of the page and added a section for recent press releases.
 
**Problem**: The links in the navigation bar didn't reflect what most visitors to the site were seeking.
**Solution**: I implemented link click tracking using Google Tag Manager in Google Analytics and I used Google Search Console to determine what queries drove traffic to our site. The data showed that most visitors were searching for a nearby Goodwill location. Based on this, I made an independent "Locations" page and added it to the front of the navigation bar. It became the most clicked link on the page.

## Homepage Before Redesign

![Homepage before redesign. Images are improperly sized. Page is chaotic and poorly organized with a lot of different colors and font sizes.](<../../public/assets/Goodwill/Old (Full).png>)

## Homepage After Redesign

## Filterable Store Locator

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a filterable store locator module for the website. The list can be filtered by type of location and searched by city name.â€‹
