# A Numbers Game

Infographics and Page Layout Design

This front page story was about the recent trend in student enrollment decreasing at Harding University.

## The Concept Behind the Cover

From the outset, we knew impactful infographics would be a key component of our enrollment coverage. The news editor and I began brainstorming data that would be relevant to the story. The charts we chose to include provide additional context and elaborate on information that wasn't covered in detail within the story.

### Why This Chart? 

**Comparing the Cost** 

Harding staff cited finances as a primary source of declining enrollment. This graph provides context for those claims by comparing Harding's net price to that of the other private Christian universities. Each of these universities increased in undergraduate en rollment. While cost may be a large factor in Harding's declining enrollment, this context prompts the reader to question why haven't finances impacted other similar schools in the same way?
