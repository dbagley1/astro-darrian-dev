# Removing the Mask

## Photo Illustration & Editorial Design

Our staff decided to dedicate one of our special editions in 2019 to raising awareness for different types of addiction and examining how Harding's policies can both help and harm students struggling with substance abuse addictions.​

The editor-in-chief, head photographer, and I worked together to decide what visuals would accompany the special edition content. I edited the photos taken by the photographers, designed the front page layout, and worked with the section editors to incorporate similar design elements on the other pages of the special edition.
