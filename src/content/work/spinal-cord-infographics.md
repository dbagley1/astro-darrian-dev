**Spinal Cord Injury Infographics and Articles**

For this project, I designed and created a series of infographics and articles about spinal cord injury (SCI) for **SpinalCord.com**, a website that helps survivors of SCI and traumatic brain injury (TBI), as well as their families, friends, and advocates. The goal of the project was to provide accurate, engaging, and accessible information about the anatomy, symptoms, treatment, and recovery of different levels of SCI, as well as to raise awareness and support for the SCI and TBI community.

The project involved the following technologies:

- **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for creating responsive and interactive web pages that display the infographics and articles.
- **Adobe Illustrator** for designing and editing the infographics using vector graphics, colors, fonts, and icons.
- **WordPress** for publishing and managing the content on SpinalCord.com, a platform that reaches thousands of visitors every month.

The project consisted of 10 infographics and articles, each covering a specific topic related to SCI, such as:

- The spinal cord anatomy and function
- The types and causes of SCI
- The levels and classifications of SCI
- The effects and complications of SCI
- The diagnosis and prognosis of SCI
- The treatment and rehabilitation of SCI
- The prevention and safety tips for SCI
- The legal and financial aspects of SCI
- The emotional and social impacts of SCI
- The resources and support groups for SCI

Each infographic was designed to be visually appealing, informative, and easy to understand, using charts, diagrams, icons, and statistics. Each article was written to be concise, clear, and comprehensive, using simple language, headings, bullet points, and references. Each infographic and article was also reviewed by experts from SpinalCord.com to ensure accuracy and quality.

The project was a rewarding experience that allowed me to apply my skills in web development, graphic design, and content writing to a meaningful cause. I learned a lot about SCI and TBI, as well as the challenges and opportunities faced by the people affected by these conditions. I also received positive feedback from SpinalCord.com and their audience, who appreciated the infographics and articles as valuable sources of information and education.
